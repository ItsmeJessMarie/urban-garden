              <h2>Why Urban Gardens?</h2>
              <h3>Sustainable future for city living</h3>
              <p>
                An urban garden or urban agriculture as it often called, refers
                to the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing
                food in urban areas. There are many different types of urban
                agriculture present in many cities today, including aquaculture,
                beekeeping, animal husbandry, and horticulture.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are numerous benefits to urban agriculture and/or gardens
                and the way it transforms the urban environment:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mitigates climate change by reducing both heat and air
                  pollution in urban landscapes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Helps conserve natural resources. Using wastewater for
                  irrigation improves water management and increases
                  availability of fresh water for household consumption. Solid
                  waste can be transformed into resources such as fertilizer for
                  growing agricultural products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vacant urban areas can be used for agricultural production
                  including community gardens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Local production of food allows numerous energy and economical
                  savings. Energy normally consumed in transporting food from
                  rural to urban centers is reduced drastically as is storage
                  and product loss which results in food cost reduction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An effective tool to fight against hunger and malnutrition
                  since it facilitates access to healthy food by an impoverished
                  sector of the urban population.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These urban gardens are essential in providing opportunity and
                growth for many city sectors and their inhabitants. It's also
                proven to be a very useful and effective educational tool to
                teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical
                activity.

                <h4>Gardens</h4>
                <p>
                  Many communities make excellent use of small urban plots
                  either at ground level or on rooftops, and make accessible to
                  the public to cultivate plants for food, recreation and
                  education. Community gardens give people the opportunity to
                  learn about horticulture and thus get a better understanding
                  of the process of producing food and other plants. In return,
                  these gardens provide food to people in need.

                <h4>Farms</h4>
                <p>
                  City/Urban farms are agricultural plots in urban areas, that
                  have people working with animals and plants to produce food.
                  These farms are usually community run and create awareness
                  surrounding agriculture and farming to people who live in
                  urbanized areas. Urban farming is a wide encompassing term as
                  farming can be done in an individual's backyard or the rooftop
                  of an apartment building. What's most important as that these
                  farms are sources of food security for many communities around
                  the world. While some urban farms have paid employees, most
                  are done on a volunteer basis and other city farms operate as
                  partnerships or co-ops within the city.

              <div>
                <h4>Aquaponics</h4>
                <p>
                  Aquaponics is a closed-loop farming technique that combines
                  both aquaculture and hydroponics to create a self-sustaining
                  ecosystem. This ecosystem includes a symbiotic relationship
                  using fish waste to naturally fertilize plants while the
                  plants filter and purify the water for the fish. This system
                  thus minimizes water usage while also eliminating the need for
                  chemical fertilizers, making this system eco-friendly and an
                  efficient method for food production.

                <h4>Vertical Farming</h4>
                <p>
                  Vertical farming has emerged as a solution for sustainable
                  urban agriculture. This type of system allows for crops to be
                  cultivated in vertically stacked layers or inclined surfaces
                  and even in controlled indoor environments. This helps
                  maximize space utilization and can even facilitate year-round
                  cultivation which is ideal for densely populated areas that
                  have limited land space. Balcony spaces in large cities have
                  proved useful for individual farming uses, whereas larger
                  farms tend to employ hydroponics or even aeroponics which can
                  allow plants to grow without soil, using nutrient-rich water
                  or air as sources instead.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="grid grid-2-columns mb-4">
              <div>
                <h4>Indoor Farms</h4>
                <p>
                  Indoor farming is a method that cultivates plants indoors,
                  free from the issues that present with traditional agriculture
                  like weather fluctuations and limited land size. The indoor
                  farming concept emerged as a solution to the ongoing
                  challenges faced by conventional agriculture such as
                  unpredictable weather patterns and urbanization taking up
                  valuable arable land. Indoor farming offers an excellent
                  sustainable alternative. These types of farms tend to use
                  advanced techniques like hydroponics, aeroponics or aquaponics
                  to cultivate plants. Having plants in a climate controlled
                  system proves useful in maintaining the perfect condition for
                  crops which in return provides superior agricultural products
                  that meet safety requirements.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Worldwide you can find countless farmers' markets that provide
                  essential crops to consumers. In some cities, there are even
                  rooftop markets that allow the produce to be kept in the same
                  area helping to reduce its carbon footprint of being shipped
                  and stored. From urban educational farms in Melbourne,
                  Australia, to Brazil's "Cities Without Hunger" policies, to
                  numerous farmers' markets in central cities in the United
                  States, it's clear that the importance of growing healthy food
                  in urban centers is undeniable. As more people move towards
                  dense urban areas, the need for these urban gardens and farms
                  will continue to increase.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When it comes to selling the food harvested, there are a few
                  options within the urban centers. The first one is called a
                  food co-op. Food co-op's are a distribution outlet that is
                  organized as a cooperative, rather than through a public or
                  private company. These co-op's are usually consumer membership
                  based, where the decisions regarding the production and
                  distribution of food are chosen by its members.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Another option for selling is through farmers' markets. These
                  are physical retail marketplaces intended to sell foods
                  directly by farmers to consumers. These shops can be either
                  indoors or outdoors and have tables or stands where farmers
                  sell their produce, live animals and plants. An example of a
                  year round farmers' market is located in Los Angeles,
                  California. The Los Angeles Farmers' Market is open seven days
                  a week and has linked several local grocers together to
                  provide varying food products. The market's central location
                  in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a
                  diverse group of sellers to connect with their consumers.
